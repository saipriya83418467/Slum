            <p>
                A slum is a highly populated urban residential area consisting of densely
                packed housing units of weak build quality and often associated with
                poverty. The infrastructure in slums is often deteriorated or incomplete,
                and they are primarily inhabited by impoverished people. Although slums
                are usually located in urban areas, in some countries they can be located
                in suburban areas where housing quality is low and living conditions are
                poor. While slums differ in size and other characteristics, most lack
                reliable sanitation services, supply of clean water, reliable electricity,
                law enforcement, and other basic services. Slum residences vary from
                shanty houses to professionally built dwellings which, because of
                poor-quality construction or lack of basic maintenance, have deteriorated.

            <h2 class="text-center">What are the problems with slums?</h2>
            <p>
                Slum dwellers in India regularly deals with problems such as lack of clean
                water, constant migration at slums, no sewage or waste disposal
                facilities, pollution, and unsanitary living conditions. High levels of
                pollution, lack of basic needs, and room-crowding are some of the basic
                characteristics of slum housing. India is a third largest country that
                suffers from poverty, malnutrition, diseases, unhealthy conditions, and
                more in Indian slums, which is alone responsible for more deaths of
                children than any other country in the world. Because of the dramatic rise
                of slums after independence, India's population has tripled. Most of the
                population is currently are slum dwellers in India. During the last two
                decades; migration from villages and small towns to metropolitan areas has
                increased tremendously in India. It leads to the degradation of urban
                environmental quality and sustainable development, especially in
                metropolitan cities. Every year, hundreds of thousands of men, women, and
                children die worldwide, and India alone is responsible for 25% of the
                deaths.
